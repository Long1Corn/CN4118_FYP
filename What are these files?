A quick test on whether CNN can discriminate L and R configuration easily on single molecule level.
58 pictures of single molecule were cropped from a microscope image
A dataset of 1450 90*90 images (Dataset.csv) is generated by augmentation of those 58 pictures, with labels stored in the first column and images stored in the following 90*90 columns.
CNN model is in Net.py
Model parameter is in mymodel.pth

It seems that high accuracy classification on single molecule level could be achieved easily.

Please ignore my terrible coding style for now.
